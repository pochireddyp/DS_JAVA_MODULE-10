# Ex24 Shortest Path and Reachability in a Heritage Town using BFS
## DATE: 26-11-2025
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program that, given a map of attractions in a heritage town connected by walking paths, recommends:
The shortest number of paths (minimum hops) from a starting attraction to a target attraction.
The number of reachable attractions from the same starting point using Breadth-First Search (BFS)


## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Represent the heritage town map as a graph using a HashMap where each key is an attraction and its value is a list of connected attractions (walking paths).
3. Implement a BFS traversal to:
4. Visit all reachable attractions from a given starting attraction.
5. Count the total number of reachable attractions.
6. Implement another BFS-based shortest path algorithm that:
7. Uses a queue and a distance map.
8. Tracks the shortest number of hops (edges) from the start to the target attraction.
9. In the main() method:
10. Define the map (graph).
11. Take a starting and target attraction.
12. Display the reachable attractions and the shortest distance.
13. Stop the program.
